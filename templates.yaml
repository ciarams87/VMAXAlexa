vmax_intro: VMAX All Flash is architected to support the densest flash configuration possible. VMAX ALL Flash provides
            higher performance, predictable latency, increased density, reduced power with the highest reliablility
            availablity and serviceability coupled with the best data services in the industry.

vmax_device_limits: VMAX All FLash and VMAX3 support devices of up to 64TB in size.  VMAX ALL FLASH volumes can be
                    dynamically expanded, and do not use meta devices.  VMAX ALL FLASH supports up to 64K volumes.

vmax_950: VMAX Nine Fifty resets the benchmark for enterprise storage performance giving results up to 5 times faster than the competition in the real world
          Compared to the previous generation. 30 percent better response times, 350 microseconds for OLTP workloads. 68 percent faster, up to 6.7M IOPS.
          25 percent smaller footprint tachieve the same performance and capacity. UNPARELLED PROTECTION and SECURITY.
          VMAX Nine Fifty supports all the data services you expect from VMAX giving you the protection your enterprise requires.

ndm_definition: Non Disruptive Migration is a unique feature of VMAX ALL FLASH and VMAX3 arrays that enables customers to migrate
                existing applications to the latest VMAX arrays while continiously protecting their environments with remote and local replication.
                Non Disruptive Migration NDM is truely seamless to the host environments requiring no downtime of the storage or the application making
                in VMAX to VMAX All Flash migrations a uniquely seamless activity.

snapvx_definition: SnapVX is the latest and greatest Local replication available on VMAX3 and VMAX ALL FLASH.  SnapVX is
                   as efficient as possible by creating a snapshot, a pointer based structure that preserves a
                   Point-in-time view of a source volume. Snapshots do not require target volumes. They share back-end allocations
                   with the source volume and other snapshots of the source volume.  And only consume additional space when
                   the source volume is changed. A single source volume can have up to 256 snapshots.

snap_resources: Simply creating a targetless snapshot does not consume any system resources.
                The snapshot storage usage grows as the source device is updated as we are preserving the original data.
                Cache and flash resources are also required to store and manage snapshot data
                and metadata, such as source device, snapshot, timestamp, and so on.

defined_meaning: When a target is linked, the defining process scans the entire target device. The
                 defining scan changes the pointers of each track on the target to share the
                 appropriate backend data for the point-in-time snapshot, which will typically be a
                 combination of source tracks and snapshot changes.
                 The defining process and shared allocations allow the target to access the
                 backend data directly and without redirection. This capability allows SnapVX to
                 offer unlimited levels of cascading, improved performance of accessing linked
                 targets compared to traditional snapshots and nocopy clones, and access to pointin-time
                 data by nocopy targets after they are unlinked.


unmount_link: Yes. The target will be toggled to the not ready state and then back to the ready
              state during the link and relink operations and will become momentarily
              unavailable. So the target should be unmounted before issuing either the link or
              relink command and then remounted after the operation completes. This action
              also ensures that the host operating system does not cache any file system data.
              Generally speaking you should unmount any volumes before refreshing the data from the storage
              array so that the host inode tables are refreshed too.

rescan_volumes: There is no EMC TimeFinder requirement to rescan after a link or unlink operation.
                Typically, the rescan requirement is dependent on the specific host operating
                system or if devices were added to the set, for example, the Storage Group.

compliance_details: There are {{ all_sg_count }} storage groups. {{ stable_sg_count }} are stable.
                    {{ marginal_sg_count }} are marginal and {{ critical_sg_count }} are critical.
                    Additionally, {{ no_slo_count }} storage groups have no S-L-O.

found_array: Selected VMAX array {{ symm_id }}


total_usable_capacity: There are {{ total_usable_cap_val }} gigabytes available.


no_array: VMAX array {{ symm_id }} not found

processing_jobs_details: There are {{ jobs_processing_count }}. They are {{ processing_jobs_list }}

host_list: There are {{ host_count }} hosts in your environment. These are {{ host_list }}.
           Which host would you like to provision storage to? Please state the name of the host and the capacity required.

no_hosts: There are no hosts configured in your environment

provision_storage: Provisioning a {{ size }} gigabyte volume to {{ host }}.
                   If you would like to query the status of the job, say "get job status".

destroy_array: Initiating self-destruct sequence, A-K-A the mother of all D-U D-L events, in five, four,
               three, two, one. Just kidding. You can't do that with VMAX.
